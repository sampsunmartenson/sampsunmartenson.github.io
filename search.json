    "title": "The Dominance of the 2022 Colorado Avalanche",
    "section": "",
    "text": "In 2022 the Colorado Avalanche hockey team had an incredibly dominant playoff run which ended with them lifting the most coveted trophy in the sport, the Stanley Cup. There were many different factors that contributed to the overall domination.\nThe three main factors being overtime victories, point differential, and how the goal scoring was able to carry the team when the goalkeeping and defense may have had some problems early on.\nTo show how great the Avalanche were at winning in overtime let’s compare them to the other playoff teams in 2022.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(gt)\nlibrary(ggbeeswarm)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(ggtext)\n#| message: false\n#| warning: false\nplayoff <- read_csv(\"data/AvalancheStats.csv\")\n\nplayoffs <- playoff %>%\n  mutate (\n    GoalDifferential = DIFF, \n    GoalsAgainst = GA,\n    GoalsFor = G\n    )\n\navs <- playoffs %>% filter(Team == \"Colorado Avalanche\")\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=playoffs, aes(x=reorder(Team, OW), weight= OW), fill=\"blue\") +\n  geom_bar(data=avs, aes(x=reorder(Team, OW), weight= OW), fill=\"maroon\") +\n  theme_minimal() + \n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Team\",\n    y = \"Overtime Wins\",\n    title=\"How good was Colorado at winning in overtime?\", \n    subtitle=\"The Avalanche won more overtime games than all other playoff teams in 2022.\",\n    caption=\"Source: Hockey Reference|By: Sampsun Martenson\") + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face= \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size=9),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=12),\n    axis.text.x = element_text(size=9),\n    axis.title.y = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggsave(\"image.png\")\n\n\nThis stat is a great place to start to show just how shut down and resilient this Avalanche team was. They went into overtime a total of six times and won all but one of them over the course of their playoff run. This also included two overtime victories in the finals.\nThe next stat we can look to is point differential to show just how ridiculous this Avalanche team was when scoring goals compared to other playoff teams. They were able to explode offensively frequently which helped them when their defense was still getting their footing in certain series.\nOverall the Avalanche defense did round into form enough to be the best team out of the final four for goals against but without the tremendous scoring happening in front of them Colorado may not have had enough time to round into form.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(\n    data=playoffs, \n    aes(x=G, y=GA, size=GoalDifferential), \n    color=\"blue\", \n    alpha=.3) + \n  geom_point(\n    data=avs, \n    aes(x=G, y=GA, size=GoalDifferential), \n    color=\"maroon\") + \n  geom_vline(xintercept = 5.7) + \n  geom_hline(yintercept = 5.55) +\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=playoffs, \n    aes(x=GoalsFor, y=GoalsAgainst, label=Team)\n  )+\n  theme_minimal()+\n  labs(\n    x = \"Goals For\",\n    y = \"Goals Against\",\n    title=\"Colorado was good defensively while exploding offensively\", \n    subtitle=\"The Avalanche Goal Differential is by far the best of all playoff teams.\",\n    caption=\"Source:Hockey Reference|By:Sampsun Martenson\") + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face= \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size=9),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=12),\n    axis.text.x = element_text(size=9),\n    axis.title.y = element_text(size=9)\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nThe final piece of this puzzle comes from how dominant the offense was able to be even when they may have been allowing more goals per game than the other high caliber defensive playoff teams.\nWhile teams like the Stars were able to lock down completely defensively they shut down offensively. This was what made this Avalanche team so dangerous because they could keep you off the board just long enough for the offense to strike and give them control back.\nThis kind of play also lead to the Avalanche goals per game being worse than their overall goals allowed due to getting better defensively as the playoffs went on.\n\n\nCode\naverage <- playoffs%>%\n  group_by(Team) %>%\n  mutate (\n    AverageGoalsScored = (G/GP),\n    AverageGoalsAllowed = (GA/GP)) %>%\n  select(Team, AverageGoalsScored, AverageGoalsAllowed)\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_dumbbell(\n    data=average, \n    aes(y=Team, x=AverageGoalsScored, xend=AverageGoalsAllowed),\n    \n    size = 2,\n    colour = \"grey\",\n    colour_x = \"green\",\n    colour_xend = \"red\")+\n  theme_minimal()+\n  labs( \n    x = \"Average Goals\",\n    y = \"Team\",\n    title=\"The Avalanche offense drove the team\", \n    subtitle = \"Colorado's <span style = 'color:green;'>AverageGoalsScored</span> is on the far right while their <span style = 'color:red;'>AverageGoalsAllowed</span> is on the left but not as dramatically due to some shakiness.\",  \n  caption=\"Source:Hockey Reference|By:Sampsun Martenson\") +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face= \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size=9),\n    axis.text.x = element_text(size=9),\n    axis.title.y = element_blank(),\n    plot.subtitle = element_textbox_simple()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nAs the stats have shown us the Avalanche were able to play a full team game where the defense would normally hold their own while the offense dominated. Even when the defense ended up being towards the top of the pack the offense was the thing that boosted the team to the heights they were able to reach.\nThe x-factor of the playoff run was when the games reached overtime however, being able to not only win some overtime games but dominate them for the most part is a key through line of the 2022 Avalanche DNA.\nAll of these factors come together to make the 2022 Avalanche a tremendous playoff team. They had everything that you could want from a modern hockey team when making a run at a championship.\nWhen teams in the future try to emulate this Colorado team and the playoff run they had in 2022 they may have quite the challenge ahead of them."

    "title": "The Rise and Collapse of the Jaguars and Titans in 2022",
    "section": "",
    "text": "In the 2022-2023 NFL season the Jacksonville Jaguars and the Tennessee Titans had an entwined destiny that seemed impossible to come to fruition at the half way point of the season. The Jaguars were 2-6 at one point in the season while the Titans once sat at 7-3.\nJacksonville after that point would go on an incredible run to end the year while Tennessee suffered major injuries and took a nosedive. This all led to the Jaguars and Titans meeting in the final week of the year to see which team would move onto the playoffs.\nBefore we talk about the final game however, we need to look at some stats that lead to the teams being in that position in the first place. We can start by looking at the point differential for the Jaguars and Titans losses.\nThe point differential of the two team’s losses is a valuable stat because it shows that even when the teams were losing, how close they may have been to actually winning those games if a couple things go differently.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(gt)\nlibrary(ggbeeswarm)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(ggtext)\nlibrary(waffle)\n\njags <- read_csv(\"data/jaguarsseason.csv\")\ntitan <- read_csv(\"data/titansseason.csv\")\nnflstats <- read_csv(\"data/nflstats.csv\")\n\njaguars <- jags%>%\n  group_by(Game) %>%\n  mutate (\n      PointDifferential = (ScoreTm-ScoreOpp)) %>%\n  select(Game, PointDifferential, ScoreTm, ScoreOpp)\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_dumbbell(\n    data=jaguars,\n    aes(y=reorder(Game, PointDifferential), x=ScoreTm, xend=ScoreOpp),\n    \n    \n    size = 2,\n    colour = \"grey\",\n    colour_x = \"green\",\n    colour_xend = \"red\")+\n  theme_minimal()+\n  labs( \n    x = \"Score\",\n    y = \"Game\",\n    title=\"Jacksonville stayed close even in losses\", \n    subtitle = \"The <span style = 'color:green;'>Jaguars Score</span> is typically close with the  <span style = 'color:red;'>Opponent Score</span> in losses showing how close their losses often were.\",  \n  caption=\"Source:Pro Football Reference|By:Sampsun Martenson\") +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face= \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size=9),\n    axis.text.x = element_text(size=9),\n    axis.title.y = element_text(size=9),\n    plot.subtitle = element_textbox_simple()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\ntitans <- titan%>%\n  group_by(Game) %>%\n  mutate (\n      PointDifferential = (ScoreTm-ScoreOpp)) %>%\n  select(Game, PointDifferential, ScoreTm, ScoreOpp)\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_dumbbell(\n    data=titans,\n    aes(y=reorder(Game, PointDifferential), x=ScoreTm, xend=ScoreOpp),\n    \n    \n    size = 2,\n    colour = \"grey\",\n    colour_x = \"green\",\n    colour_xend = \"red\")+\n  theme_minimal()+\n  labs( \n    x = \"Score\",\n    y = \"Game\",\n    title=\"Meanwhile Tennessee got blown out\", \n    subtitle = \"The <span style = 'color:green;'>Titans Score</span> is typically far away from the  <span style = 'color:red;'>Opponent Score</span> in losses showing how lopsided their losses often were.\",  \n  caption=\"Source:Pro Football Reference|By:Sampsun Martenson\") +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face= \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size=9),\n    axis.text.x = element_text(size=9),\n    axis.title.y = element_text(size=9),\n    plot.subtitle = element_textbox_simple()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggsave(\"image.png\")\n\n\nJacksonville’s losses were often close showing how they were better than their record, especially early on in the season. On the other side the Titans had many games where their wins were close and their losses were often blowouts. This goes into showing how Tennessee’s record may have not been as solid as it seemed.\nWe can then look at the total total first down differential for the Jaguars and Titans. This was an interesting faze of the games to look at for both of these teams due to how it showed just how both offenses compared in consistency.\nTeams can often have less first downs if they are a more explosive team such as the Chiefs but neither Jacksonville or Tennessee’s offense is focused on big plays. Both teams often try to meticulously move down the field through short but consistent gains of yards.\nThis is where it becomes noticeable just how much Jacksonville dominated this category. The Titans had a total of 277 first downs compared to 352 by the Jaguars. Put this into an entire season and it shows how Tennessee’s offense often couldn’t get anything consistent going while Jacksonville was very consistent while moving the ball.\n\n\nCode\njo <- c(\"firstdowns\"=352)\nto <- c(\"firstdowns\"=277)\n\ntotal <- c(\"Jaguars\"=352, \"Titans\"=277)\n\nwaffle(\n        total/10, \n        rows = 5, \n        title=\"Jaguars vs Titans: Total first downs\", \n        xlab=\"1 square =  10 first downs\", \n        colors = c(\"gold\", \"lightblue\")\n)+\n  theme_minimal()+\n  labs( \n    x = \"1 square = 10 first downs\",\n    y = \"Week\",\n    title=\"The first down numbers for Jacksonville overpowered Tennessee.\", \n    subtitle = \"The Jaguars were consistently moving the ball on offense, meanwhile the Titans had more trouble being consistent.\",  \n  caption=\"Source:Pro Football Reference|By:Sampsun Martenson\") +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face= \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size=9),\n    axis.text.x = element_text(size=9),\n    axis.title.y = element_blank(),\n    plot.subtitle = element_textbox_simple()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally we can look at the difference in passing offense between the two teams. The Jaguars had a quarterback in Trevor Lawrence who was able to be relied on, especially in the second half of the year, along with other offensive weapons that helped them have a good passing attack.\nThis was a large component of what allowed the Jaguars to have such a large turnaround in the second half of the season, the passing game found its footing.\nOn the other side of the coin was the Titans passing offense which for a large portion of the year was quarterbacked by Ryan Tannehill. He wasn’t able to set any records but he was a passable leader to rely on for the passing game.\nThis changed when Tannehill was injured during the season and Tennessee had to scramble to try to find a competent backup. This is the reason for the passing game taking a nosedive late in the year for the Titans along with being a large reason for the Titans late season collapse.\n\n\nCode\njagsnfl<- nflstats%>%\n  filter(Tm == \"Jacksonville Jaguars\")\n\ntitansnfl<- nflstats%>%\n  filter(Tm == \"Tennessee Titans\")\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(\n    data=nflstats, \n    aes(x=TD, y=Yds...7, size=Cmp), \n    color=\"red\", \n    alpha=.3) + \n  geom_point(\n    data=jagsnfl, \n    aes(x=TD, y=Yds...7, size=Cmp), \n    color=\"gold\") + \n    geom_point(\n    data=titansnfl, \n    aes(x=TD, y=Yds...7, size=Cmp), \n    color=\"lightblue\") +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 5.7) + \n  geom_hline(yintercept = 5.55) +\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=jagsnfl, \n    aes(x=TD, y=Yds...7, label=Tm),\n    color=\"black\") +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 5.7) + \n  geom_hline(yintercept = 5.55) +\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=titansnfl,\n    aes(x=TD, y=Yds...7, label=Tm),\n    color=\"black\")+\n  theme_minimal()+\n  labs( \n    x = \"Passing Touchdowns\",\n    y = \"Passing Yards\",\n    title=\"The Jaguars passing game was far ahead of the Titans\", \n    subtitle = \"Jacksonville's passing offense was ranked close to the top of the league while Tennessee was one of the worst.\",  \n  caption=\"Source:Pro Football Reference|By:Sampsun Martenson\") +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face= \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size=9),\n    axis.text.x = element_text(size=9),\n    axis.title.y = element_text(size=9),\n    plot.subtitle = element_textbox_simple()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter everything was said and done the Jaguars and Titans met each other in the last week of the regular season in a mini playoff game where the winner went to the playoffs. The Jaguars ended up using all of these different facets of their game that improved over the course of the season and beat the Titans to move onto the playoffs.\nThe Titans over the course of the season had many things go wrong for them to have the unfortunate end to the season that they did. The Jaguars had many things start working for them at about the same time everything started falling apart for Tennessee.\nJacksonville has now found a way to play that fits them well through all of this and with some new additions to the team they may be able to keep up the impressive showing they had towards the end of this season for years to come."
