    "title": "The Dominance of the 2022 Colorado Avalanche",
    "section": "",
    "text": "In 2022 the Colorado Avalanche hockey team had an incredibly dominant playoff run which ended with them lifting the most coveted trophy in the sport, the Stanley Cup. There were many different factors that contributed to the overall domination.\nThe three main factors being overtime victories, point differential, and how the goal scoring was able to carry the team when the goalkeeping and defense may have had some problems early on.\nTo show how great the Avalanche were at winning in overtime letâ€™s compare them to the other playoff teams in 2022.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(gt)\nlibrary(ggbeeswarm)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(ggtext)\n#| message: false\n#| warning: false\nplayoff <- read_csv(\"data/AvalancheStats.csv\")\n\nplayoffs <- playoff %>%\n  mutate (\n    GoalDifferential = DIFF, \n    GoalsAgainst = GA,\n    GoalsFor = G\n    )\n\navs <- playoffs %>% filter(Team == \"Colorado Avalanche\")\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=playoffs, aes(x=reorder(Team, OW), weight= OW), fill=\"blue\") +\n  geom_bar(data=avs, aes(x=reorder(Team, OW), weight= OW), fill=\"maroon\") +\n  theme_minimal() + \n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Team\",\n    y = \"Overtime Wins\",\n    title=\"How good was Colorado at winning in overtime?\", \n    subtitle=\"The Avalanche won more overtime games than all other playoff teams in 2022.\",\n    caption=\"Source: Hockey Reference|By: Sampsun Martenson\") + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face= \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size=9),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=12),\n    axis.text.x = element_text(size=9),\n    axis.title.y = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggsave(\"image.png\")\n\n\nThis stat is a great place to start to show just how shut down and resilient this Avalanche team was. They went into overtime a total of six times and won all but one of them over the course of their playoff run. This also included two overtime victories in the finals.\nThe next stat we can look to is point differential to show just how ridiculous this Avalanche team was when scoring goals compared to other playoff teams. They were able to explode offensively frequently which helped them when their defense was still getting their footing in certain series.\nOverall the Avalanche defense did round into form enough to be the best team out of the final four for goals against but without the tremendous scoring happening in front of them Colorado may not have had enough time to round into form.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(\n    data=playoffs, \n    aes(x=G, y=GA, size=GoalDifferential), \n    color=\"blue\", \n    alpha=.3) + \n  geom_point(\n    data=avs, \n    aes(x=G, y=GA, size=GoalDifferential), \n    color=\"maroon\") + \n  geom_vline(xintercept = 5.7) + \n  geom_hline(yintercept = 5.55) +\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=playoffs, \n    aes(x=GoalsFor, y=GoalsAgainst, label=Team)\n  )+\n  theme_minimal()+\n  labs(\n    x = \"Goals For\",\n    y = \"Goals Against\",\n    title=\"Colorado was good defensively while exploding offensively\", \n    subtitle=\"The Avalanche Goal Differential is by far the best of all playoff teams.\",\n    caption=\"Source:Hockey Reference|By:Sampsun Martenson\") + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face= \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size=9),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=12),\n    axis.text.x = element_text(size=9),\n    axis.title.y = element_text(size=9)\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nThe final piece of this puzzle comes from how dominant the offense was able to be even when they may have been allowing more goals per game than the other high caliber defensive playoff teams.\nWhile teams like the Stars were able to lock down completely defensively they shut down offensively. This was what made this Avalanche team so dangerous because they could keep you off the board just long enough for the offense to strike and give them control back.\nThis kind of play also lead to the Avalanche goals per game being worse than their overall goals allowed due to getting better defensively as the playoffs went on.\n\n\nCode\naverage <- playoffs%>%\n  group_by(Team) %>%\n  mutate (\n    AverageGoalsScored = (G/GP),\n    AverageGoalsAllowed = (GA/GP)) %>%\n  select(Team, AverageGoalsScored, AverageGoalsAllowed)\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_dumbbell(\n    data=average, \n    aes(y=Team, x=AverageGoalsScored, xend=AverageGoalsAllowed),\n    \n    size = 2,\n    colour = \"grey\",\n    colour_x = \"green\",\n    colour_xend = \"red\")+\n  theme_minimal()+\n  labs( \n    x = \"Average Goals\",\n    y = \"Team\",\n    title=\"The Avalanche offense drove the team\", \n    subtitle = \"Colorado's <span style = 'color:green;'>AverageGoalsScored</span> is on the far right while their <span style = 'color:red;'>AverageGoalsAllowed</span> is on the left but not as dramatically due to some shakiness.\",  \n  caption=\"Source:Hockey Reference|By:Sampsun Martenson\") +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face= \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size=9),\n    axis.text.x = element_text(size=9),\n    axis.title.y = element_blank(),\n    plot.subtitle = element_textbox_simple()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nAs the stats have shown us the Avalanche were able to play a full team game where the defense would normally hold their own while the offense dominated. Even when the defense ended up being towards the top of the pack the offense was the thing that boosted the team to the heights they were able to reach.\nThe x-factor of the playoff run was when the games reached overtime however, being able to not only win some overtime games but dominate them for the most part is a key through line of the 2022 Avalanche DNA.\nAll of these factors come together to make the 2022 Avalanche a tremendous playoff team. They had everything that you could want from a modern hockey team when making a run at a championship.\nWhen teams in the future try to emulate this Colorado team and the playoff run they had in 2022 they may have quite the challenge ahead of them."
