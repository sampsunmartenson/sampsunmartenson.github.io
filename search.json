    "text": "In 2022 the Colorado Avalanche hockey team had an incredibly dominant playoff run which ended with them lifting the most coveted trophy in the sport, the Stanley Cup. There were many different factors that contributed to the overall domination.\nThe three main factors being overtime victories, point differential, and how the goal scoring was able to carry the team when the goalkeeping and defense may have let the team down.\nTo show how great the Avalanche were at winning in overtime let’s compare them to the other playoff teams in 2022.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n\n── Attaching packages ─────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse 1.3.2 ──\n✔ ggplot2 3.4.0      ✔ purrr   1.0.1 \n✔ tibble  3.1.8      ✔ dplyr   1.0.10\n✔ tidyr   1.2.1      ✔ stringr 1.5.0 \n✔ readr   2.1.3      ✔ forcats 0.5.2 \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(readr)\n\n\n\n\nCode\nplayoffs <- read_csv(\"data/AvalancheStats.csv\")\n\n\nRows: 16 Columns: 12\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr  (1): Team\ndbl (11): Rk, GP, W, L, T, OW, OL, W-L%, G, GA, DIFF\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\n\nCode\navs <- playoffs %>% filter(Team == \"Colorado Avalanche\")\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=playoffs, aes(x=reorder(Team, OW), weight= OW), fill=\"black\") +\n  geom_bar(data=avs, aes(x=reorder(Team, OW), weight= OW), fill=\"maroon\") +\n  theme_minimal() + \n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Overtime Wins\",\n    y = \"Overtime Wins\",\n    title=\"The Avalanche were very good at winning in overtime\", \n    subtitle=\"Colorado had more overtime victories than any other playoff team in 2022.\",\n    caption=\"Source: Hockey Reference | Graphic by Sampsun Martenson\") + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 10),\n    axis.title.y = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggsave(\"image.png\")\n\n\nSaving 7 x 5 in image"
