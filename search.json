    "text": "In 2022 the Colorado Avalanche hockey team had an incredibly dominant playoff run which ended with them lifting the most coveted trophy in the sport, the Stanley Cup. There were many different factors that contributed to the overall domination.\nThe three main factors being overtime victories, point differential, and how the goal scoring was able to carry the team when the goalkeeping and defense may have let the team down.\nTo show how great the Avalanche were at winning in overtime letâ€™s compare them to the other playoff teams in 2022.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(gt)\nlibrary(ggbeeswarm)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(ggtext)\n#| message: false\n#| warning: false\nplayoff <- read_csv(\"data/AvalancheStats.csv\")\n\nplayoffs <- playoff %>%\n  mutate (\n    GoalDifferential = DIFF, \n    GoalsAgainst = GA,\n    GoalsFor = G\n    )\n\navs <- playoffs %>% filter(Team == \"Colorado Avalanche\")\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=playoffs, aes(x=reorder(Team, OW), weight= OW), fill=\"blue\") +\n  geom_bar(data=avs, aes(x=reorder(Team, OW), weight= OW), fill=\"maroon\") +\n  theme_minimal() + \n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Overtime Wins\",\n    y = \"Overtime Wins\",\n    title=\"The Avalanche were very good at winning in overtime\", \n    subtitle=\"Colorado had more overtime victories than any other playoff team in 2022.\",\n    caption=\"Source: Hockey Reference | Graphic by Sampsun Martenson\") + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 10),\n    axis.title.y = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggsave(\"image.png\")\n\n\nThis stat is a great place to start to show just how shut down and resiliant this Avalanche team was. They went into overtime a total of six times and won all but one of them over the course of their playoff run. This also included two overtime victories in the finals.\nThe next stat we can look to is point differential to show just how ridiculous this Avalanche team was when scoring goals compared to other playoff teams.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(\n    data=playoffs, \n    aes(x=G, y=GA, size=GoalDifferential), \n    color=\"blue\", \n    alpha=.3) + \n  geom_point(\n    data=avs, \n    aes(x=G, y=GA, size=GoalDifferential), \n    color=\"maroon\") + \n  geom_vline(xintercept = 5.7) + \n  geom_hline(yintercept = 5.55) +\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=playoffs, \n    aes(x=GoalsFor, y=GoalsAgainst, label=Team)\n  )+\n  theme_minimal()+\n    labs(\n    x = \"Goals For\",\n    y = \"Goals Against\",\n    title=\"Colorado's Goals for and Goals Against Are an Incredible Ratio.\", \n    subtitle=\"The Avalanche Goal Differential is by far the best of all playoff teams.\",\n    caption=\"Source: Hockey Reference | Graphic by Sampsun Martenson\") + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 10),\n    axis.title.y = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nThe final piece of this puzzle comes from how dominant the offense was able to be even when they may have been allowing more goals per game than the average playoff team.\n\n\nCode\naverage <- playoffs%>%\n  group_by(Team) %>%\n  mutate (\n    AverageGoalsScored = (G/GP),\n    AverageGoalsAllowed = (GA/GP)) %>%\n  select(Team, AverageGoalsScored, AverageGoalsAllowed)\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_dumbbell(\n    data=average, \n    aes(y=Team, x=AverageGoalsScored, xend=AverageGoalsAllowed),\n    \n    size = 2,\n    colour = \"grey\",\n    colour_x = \"green\",\n    colour_xend = \"red\")+\n  theme_minimal()+\n  labs( \n    x = \"Average Goals\",\n    y = \"Team\",\n    title=\"The Avalanche have a great offense that offsets an average defense\", \n    subtitle = \"If <span style = 'color:green;'>AverageGoalsScored</span> is on the right the team is doing well. If <span style = 'color:red;'>AverageGoalsAllowed</span> is on the right, not so much.\",  \n  caption=\"Source: Hockey Reference | Graphic by Sampsun Martenson\") +\n  theme(\n    plot.subtitle = element_textbox_simple()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nAll of this comes together to make the 2022 Avalanche a tremendous playoff team."
